# Ucuddle-Fast-PageRank

## Results

- The results of the first version of algorithm (29.04.2021) you can find [here](https://github.com/denysgerasymuk799/Ucuddle-Fast-PageRank/blob/main/version1_result_domain_ranks.json)
  (json is sorted from highest to lowest ranks). Algorithm was tested only on 1000 web pages, but we have already noticed efficiency and
  right direction of ranks for special websites.
